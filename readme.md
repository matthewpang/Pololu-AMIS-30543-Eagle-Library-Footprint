This library has 3 different parts

1)POLOLU-AMIS-30543-ALLPADS/ALLHOLES
    This variant is a complete footprint - it contains all the pads and all the holes.
 
2)POLOLU-AMIS-30543-PINHEADERS
    This variant contains the footprint/holes for the 0.1" pin headers only. The holes for the terminal block/screw terminal are left out. These still contain holes for the mounting points on the top and bottom right of the board. 
    
3)POLOLU-AMIS-30543-TERMINALBLOCKS
    This variant contains the footprint/holes for just the Terminal Blocks. The holes for the 0.1" headers for the VMOT, VMOTGND and MOT* pins are left out. These still contain holes for the mounting points on the top and bottom right of the board.
